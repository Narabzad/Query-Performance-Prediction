# Query-Performance-Prediction
Results of state-of-the-art pre-retrieval and post-retrieval QPP methods on TREC datasets

You can find results of state-of-the-art query performance prediction methods on well-known TREC datasets such as Robust04, GOV2, ClueWeb09 and  ClueWeb12.

Aggregating functions such as {avg,min,max,sum} has been utilized on query terms to calculate the QPP for the whole query.

Details of each of the methods can be found in the following references:
